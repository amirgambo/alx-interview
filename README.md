Pascal's Triangle is a triangular array of numbers named after the mathematician Blaise Pascal. The numbers in the triangle are generated by summing the two numbers directly above each cell. The triangle starts with a row consisting of only a single number 1, and each subsequent row is constructed by adding the numbers from the previous row. It is a fascinating geometric pattern that showcases many mathematical properties and is widely used in various areas of mathematics and computer science.
